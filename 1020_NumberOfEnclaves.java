// public You are given an m x n binary matrix grid, where 0 represents a sea cell and 1 represents a land cell.

// A move consists of walking from one land cell to another adjacent (4-directionally) land cell or walking off the boundary of the grid.

// Return the number of land cells in grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0],[1,0,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There are three 1s that are enclosed by 0s, and one 1 that is not enclosed because its on the boundary.
// Example 2:


// Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
// Output: 0
// Explanation: All 1s are either on the boundary or can reach the boundary. {
    
// }
