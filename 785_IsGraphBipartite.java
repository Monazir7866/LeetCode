// There is an undirected graph with n nodes, where each node is numbered between 0 and n - 1. You are given a 2D array graph, where graph[u] is an array of nodes that node u is adjacent to. More formally, for each v in graph[u], there is an undirected edge between node u and node v. The graph has the following properties:

// There are no self-edges (graph[u] does not contain u).
// There are no parallel edges (graph[u] does not contain duplicate values).
// If v is in graph[u], then u is in graph[v] (the graph is undirected).
// The graph may not be connected, meaning there may be two nodes u and v such that there is no path between them.
// A graph is bipartite if the nodes can be partitioned into two independent sets A and B such that every edge in the graph connects a node in set A and a node in set B.

// Return true if and only if it is bipartite.

 

// Example 1:


// Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[0,2],[0,1,3],[0,2]]
// Output: false
// Explanation: There is no way to partition the nodes into two independent sets such that every edge connects a node in one and a node in the other.
// Example 2:


// Input: graph = [[1,3],[0,2],[1,3],[0,2]]
// Output: true
// Explanation: We can partition the nodes into two sets: {0, 2} and {1, 3}.
